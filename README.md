# Maya_Grass_Clump_Generator
Maya Python tool for generating grass clumps for game engines from single foliage meshes
This tool is a work in progress and is not ready for production-use.

The intention behind this tool, is to generate single-mesh clumps from a selection of single foliage types (i.e. grass, flowers, ferns etc.) whilst also rendering out flat billboards of the same clump for use in real-time engines.

# Installation
This tool can be installed in Maya by locating the setup.py script in a file explorer, and dragging and dropping it into the Maya viewport. The tool will appear in the active shelf.
